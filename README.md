# üöÄ Next.js Boilerplate

This is a **Next.js boilerplate** that comes with configured **ESLint** rules and **Prettier** for code formatting. All unnecessary files and placeholders from the original `create-next-app` template have been removed, so you can focus directly on development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkianJS/nextjs-boilerplate.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses `pnpm` for package management. If you don't have it installed, you can install it globally by running:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Once `pnpm` is installed, navigate to the cloned directory and install the project dependencies:

```bash
cd nextjs-boilerplate
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

## üö® ESLint & Prettier

This boilerplate is pre-configured with **ESLint** for linting and **Prettier** for code formatting. You can customize the configuration by modifying the `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc` files.

## üßπ Clean Slate for Development

Everything you don't need has been removed from the initial `create-next-app` setup. Once you've cloned the repository, you can remove the `.git` folder and start fresh with your own repository:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

After this, feel free to initialize a new Git repository for your project and start developing!
